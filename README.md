# Surge DOMAIN-SETs for blocking ads / trackers / malware etc.

A simple script that converts reliable and regularly updated blocklists to a format compatible with [Surge](https://nssurge.com) DOMAIN-SETs.

Surge uses '.' prefixes for wildcard domains, so this simply converts the ready-made wildcard lists from '*.' prefixes to '.'

All credits to [hagezi](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/tree/main) and [OISD](https://oisd.nl) and their sources.

README will be updated with more details, but file names are pretty self-explanatory...

In the meantime, check out hagezi's repo and OISD website for more info for more details!
